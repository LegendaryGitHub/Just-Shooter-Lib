Resources used for finding the equations:
Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion#Angle_%CE%B8_required_to_hit_coordinate_(x,_y)
1. Maximum distance of projectile
2. Maximum height of projectile
3. Velocity - both the x- and y- axis

Current Stage (Current Commit Notes):
- Working on documenting (this page :)
- Should work for a non-moving bot (not tested on a bot, just basic java)
- No current constraints for min/max RPM
- Velocity Calculations are set up and work within margin of error
- No vision has been implemented
- Very barebones 

Stage 1: 
- Document
- Usage for non-moving bot
- Shot constraints min/max RPM
- Object Velocity Setup
- Drag - constant
- Vision Target (x,y,z)
- High center constant RPM Shot

Stage 2: 
- Approach angle target
- Pace/Odometry/Unility
- Shot Ok base on the distance and target size
- Confidenet repeat / shot see in odometry zone constraints

Stage 3:
- Shots on the run
- Least effort control
